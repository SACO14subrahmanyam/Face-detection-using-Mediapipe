# Face Detection using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This Python script demonstrates how to perform real-time face detection using the MediaPipe library and OpenCV. It captures video from the default camera and overlays bounding boxes around detected faces.

## Prerequisites

Before running this code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV (cv2)
- MediaPipe
- NumPy (optional but commonly used in image processing)

You can install these libraries using pip:
